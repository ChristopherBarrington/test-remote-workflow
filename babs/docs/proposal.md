<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>In mice, the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus has
lifelong neurogenic capabilities due to the presence of adult
hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs or AHNSCs). Activation of NSCs
proliferation gives rise to neural progenitors, which will form the
dentate granule neurons upon differentiation, and/or new NSCs. In
absence of mitogenic signals, NSCs enter a non-dividing reversible state
or quiescence. As NSCs remain quiescent for longer duration, they move
progressively into deeper quiescence and display a reduced sensitivity
to growth signals. In juvenile mice, all proliferating hippocampal NSCs
differentiate into neuronal progenitors, whereas in adult mice (6 months
of age) more than half of the dividing NSCs self-renew and return to
quiescence.</p>
<p>Previous results from the lab demonstrate that the decision of adult
hippocampal NSC to re-enter the cell cycle or remain quiescent depends
on ASCL1 protein levels (Harris L. et al 2021). ASCL1 is a pioneer
transcription factor and thus it has the capacity to associate with
condensed chromatin to facilitate the binding of additional
transcription factors and it can directly modulate chromatin
accessibility, recruit other transcription factors and chromatin
modification enzymes. Other results from the lab also suggest that
significant transcriptional and chromatin accessibility changes occur
between activated and quiescent NSCs, based on previous snRNA-Seq (Fig.
1) analysis and preliminary snATAC-Seq analysis.</p>

<p>Figure 1. single cell RNA-Seq analysis of adult hippocampal NSCs.
After two iterations of subsetting and re-clustering, a dataset of 2,947
NSCs was ordered using Slingshot, revealing a pseudotime trajectory from
the most quiescent NSCs (blue) to proliferating NSCs (red) (Harris L. et
al 2021).</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong></p>
<p>We propose that adult hippocampal NSC behavior is defined by their
epigenetic status, and thus the decision of adult hippocampal NSCs to
proliferate or remain quiescent is controlled cell intrinsically at the
chromatin level. In this model, quiescent NSCs from young mice would
present a partially closed chromatin configuration at loci involved in
NSC activity, and the chromatin configuration in these loci would be
closed more tightly as NSCs enter a deeper quiescence state in old
mice.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p>Profiling of genome-wide chromatin accessibility and RNA expression
in the same individual adult hippocampal NSCs.</p>
<p>To explore the gene regulatory network that controls the maintenance
of quiescent AHNSCs and the progression of NSCs from quiescence to
activation, we plan to combine discovery of regulatory elements with
gene expression by simultaneous detection of mRNA and chromatin
accessibility from the same cell. The analysis of associations between
variation in gene expression and chromatin accessibility within the same
single cell will allow relationships to be identified unambiguously.</p>
<p>We will perform single cell multiome ATAC and RNA sequencing <em>in
vivo.</em> For this we will use a mouse strain generated by Dr. Kaja
Maczulska in which cells transcribing <em>Ascl1</em> express a
histone-tagged mCherry. To select the hippocampal NSCs we will use
FACS.</p>
<p>The scRNA-Seq data analysis will allow us to identify quiescent and
active NSCs and associate opened chromatin regions with active genes,
whereas the scATAC-Seq analysis will allow us to determine the
difference between quiescent and active NSCs at the chromatin level. We
propose that the chromatin accessibility level will correlate with the
position of cells along the quiescent to active axis.</p>
<p>Moreover, we plan to examine the role of TFs including ASCL1 and MYCN
in driving chromatin accessibility changes in NSCs by 1) examining
transcription factor binding sites in differential ATAC-Seq regions
between quiescent and active NSCs and 2) comparing the ATAC-Seq signal
with the CUT&amp;RUN signals for ASCL1 and MYCN generated in a parallel
project (PM22021). This will determine the role of TFs including Ascl1
and MycN in driving chromatin changes between quiescent and active NSCs,
and address the hypothesis that Ascl1 has distinct activities in
quiescent and active NSCs which we proposed in the above-mentioned
CUT&amp;RUN project proposal (PM22021).</p></th>

<p><strong>Sample preparation</strong></p>
<p>All animal-related experimental procedures will be carried out under
ethical guidelines.</p>
<p>Mice will be killed by cervical dislocation and their brains removed.
Mouse dentate gyrus will be dissected, cut into small pieces and
transferred to a tube containing 300 Î¼L ice cold NP40 nuclei lysis
buffer comprising 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1%
Nonidet P40, 1mM DTT and 1 U/ Î¼L RNase inhibitor in nuclease-free water.
The following procedure will be followed to extract the nuclei from the
dentate gyrus tissue: homogenization 15 times on ice cold nuclei lysis
buffer using a Pellet Pestle, incubation with 1 mL of ice-cold NP40
nuclei lysis buffer on ice for 5 min. Nuclei suspensions were passed
through a 70 Î¼m Flowmi filter (VWR Bel-Art SP Scienceware). Then, nuclei
will be pelleted by centrifugation at 500rcf for 5 min at 4ÂºC leaving 50
Î¼L of supernatant and adding 1mL of PBS 1% BSA 1 U/ Î¼L RNase inhibitor
without mixing. After incubation on ice for 5 min, nuclei pellet willbe
resuspended and the nuclei suspension centrifugated at 500 rcf for 5 min
at 4ÂºC. Finally, nuclei pellet will be resuspended with 1mL of PBS 1%
BSA 1 U/ Î¼L RNase inhibitor and 10 Î¼L of 7-amino-actinomycin D (7AAD)
ready-made solution will be added to analyse viable cells in flow
cytometry.</p>
<p>To select only the nuclei of the cells that express <em>Ascl1</em>,
mCherry+ 7AAD+ nuclei will be sorted using a 100 Î¼m nozzle and a flow
rate of 3 on a FACS Fusion A flow cytometer into a 5 mL FACS tube
containing 500 Î¼L BSA with 5000U RNase inhibitor. After sorting, nuclei
concentration will be assessed using a hemocytometer/ the Countess II FL
Automated Cell Counter. The sorted nuclei will be pellet by
centrifugation at 500 rcf for 5 min at 4ÂºC, resuspended in 100 Î¼L of
0.1X Lysis Buffer comprising 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM
MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 0.01% Digitonin, 1% BSA, 1mM DTT
and 1 U/ Î¼L RNase inhibitor in nuclease-free water and incubated on ice
for 2 min. Nuclei suspension will be mixed with 1 mL of Wash buffer
containing 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20,
1% BSA, 1mM DTT and 1 U/ Î¼L RNase inhibitor in nuclease-free water.
Nuclei will be pelleted by centrifugation at 500 rcf for 5 min at 4ÂºC
and resuspended in ice cold Diluted Nuclei buffer comprising 1X Nuclei
buffer (10x Genomics), 1mM DTT and 1 U/ Î¼L RNase inhibitor in
nuclease-free water. Finally, nuclei concentration will be assessed
using a hemocytometer/ the Countess II FL Automated Cell
Counter.</p></td>
